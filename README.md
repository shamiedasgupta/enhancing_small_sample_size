<h1>Enhancing Small Sample Inference: Leveraging Resampling-Based Methods as a Superior Alternative to Traditional Non-Parametric Tests</h1>
<h2>Authorsâ€™ Name: Shamie Dasgupta, Aishani Dey, Pratyusha Mukhopadhyay, Arnab Dutta</h2>
<p>Small sample sizes pose a significant challenge in statistical inference particularly for situations especially when data deviate from normality where traditional non-parametric tests also have long been the go-to solution. Resampling-based methods (especially Bootstrap and Permutation tests) have gained prominence in recent years aiding various inference problems without relying on specific distributional assumptions. In this research, our aim is to compare the efficacy of these tests over non-parametric test through simulations and power-performance verification to establish these methods as an alternative to face challenges of small sample size inference, ultimately enhancing the reliability of statistical analysis in various fields.</p>
